# MKT
MKT.js is an Exchange Price Service , Stocks , Cryptocurrency,Stock prediction and more \
This package contains hundreds of currencies, cryptocurrencies and stocks prices. It also works with the TensorFlow  
for market forecasting / stock prediction using RNN and also works on the visualizing of stocks data using canvas.js

## Dependencies
- Neural Networks (brain.js)
- Tensorflow Framework (tensorflow.js)
- Data visualization (canvas.js)
- Main Api ( min-api.cryptocompare.com )

## Some of the ideas I put forward and you can get started:
- Add processing of natural languages to increase confidence in prices that have been predicted 
- Add simulation of the investment process and the development of some strategies of trades.
- Monitor the markets and manufacture a global dashboard.
- add simples and examples using MKT.JS
